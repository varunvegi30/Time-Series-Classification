# Time-Series-Classification

In this problem, I attempted classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network.

### Dataset description - 
AReM data - The dataset contains 7 folders that represent seven types of activities. Each file containis 6 time series collected from activities of the same person.

### Solution Overview - 
Section 1 - Binary classification (Classification of bending from other activities)
Algorithms used - Logistic Regression and L1 penalized Logistic Regression
In the former, variable selection was done using Recursive feature elimination

Section 2 - Multi-class classification 
Algorithms used - L1 penalized multinomial Regression and Naive Bayes' classifier.

Section 3 - Comparison of models
